## I learned from this:
- We can return a `struct` from function.
- We can assign one `struct` to another `struct` using `=` operator easily.
  It created a shallow copy of struct.
- Similarly we can assign a struct to an array index without using `memcpy`, it also seems to be using shallow copy internally.
